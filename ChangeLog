	* btopn.c: Fix memory leak when opening non-existent files or other
	initialisation errors.

2006-04-09  Mark Willson  <mark@gold>

	* Make sleep time for locked file an implementation constant, set
	in bc.h

	* Fix hardcoded error message for signal setup failure in bsemap.c.

	* btdata.c: Allow zero-length data records to be stored.  Fix
	index file block leak when attempting to define a duplicate key.

	* bclrlf.c: Initialise lfblk

	* Detect and fail gracefully when the index file reaches maximum
	size (that's 2^31-1 bytes on a 32 bit int implementation).

	* Detect overflow of data block addressing.

2004-09-08  Mark Willson  <mark@crimson>

	* Verify correct version of Btree file on open.  This involves a
	small change to the structure of the B tree index file.  The first
	word now contains a version identified in the most significant
	halfword, while the ZROOT flag lives in the least significant
	halfword. The routines which get and set block data cater for this
	automatically.

	* All: changes to API - removal of int *ok from function argument
	  lists.
