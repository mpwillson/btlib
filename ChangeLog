	key.
	
2008-05-21  Mark Willson  <mark@gold>

	* bxdump.c: Make routine of type void, as defined in "btree_int.h"

	* bt.c: Replace use of FILENO macro by fileno function.

	* bacini.c: Replace use of FILENO macro by fileno function.

	* bc.h: Remove macro defining FILENO - replaced by standard C
	library function fileno.

	* bsemap.c: Included file <sys/fcntl.h> replaced by <fcntl.h>.

2006-08-18  Mark Willson  <mark@gold>

	* btopn.c: Fix memory leak on btact initialisation error.

2006-04-09  Mark Willson  <mark@gold>

	* bc.h: Make sleep time for locked file an implementation constant

	* bsemap.c: Fix hardcoded error message for signal setup failure

2005-12-27  Mark Willson  <mark@gold>

	* btdata.c: Allow zero-length data records to be stored.  Fix
	index file block leak when attempting to define a duplicate key.  

2005-10-30  Mark Willson  <mark@gold>

	* bclrlf.c: Initialise lfblk
	* bnxtky.c: Handle calls if bfndky has not been called before

2004-09-25  Mark Willson  <mark@gold>

	* Detect and fail gracefully when the index file reaches maximum
	size (that's 2^31-1 bytes on a 32 bit int implementation).

2004-09-22  Mark Willson  <mark@gold>

	* Detect overflow of data block addressing.

2004-09-08  Mark Willson  <mark@crimson>

	* Verify correct version of Btree file on open.  This involves a
	small change to the structure of the B tree index file.  The first
	word now contains a version identified in the most significant
	halfword, while the ZROOT flag lives in the least significant
	halfword. The routines which get and set block data cater for this
	automatically.

2004-05-31  Mark Willson  <mark@crimson>

	* All: changes to API - removal of int *ok from function argument
	  lists.
